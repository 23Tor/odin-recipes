    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Cooking spray</li>
        <li>2 18.25-ounce boxes chocolate cake mix</li>
        <li>8 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 cups buttermilk</li>
        <li>1 cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1/4 cup green decorating sugar or granulated sugar</li>
        <li>8 spearmint leaf gummy candies</li>
        <li>3 ounces orange rolled fondant (available at craft stores)</li>
        <li>Cornstarch, for dusting</li>
        <li>1 16-ounce tub vanilla frosting</li>
        <li>1 16-ounce tub chocolate frosting</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon yellow food coloring</li>
        <li>5 drops red food coloring</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons crispy rice cereal</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spray a 2 1/2-quart ovenproof bowl and two 8-inch-round cake pans with
            cooking spray. Beat the cake mix, eggs, buttermilk and vegetable oil in a large bowl with a mixer.</li>
        <li>Divide the batter among the bowl and pans; bake until a toothpick comes out clean, about 25 minutes for the
            pans and about 45 minutes for the bowl. Cool in the pans 15 minutes, then unmold onto racks.</li>
        <li>Make the lettuce: Sprinkle some green or white sugar on a cutting board. Roll out the spearmint candies to
            1/8 inch thick with a rolling pin, sprinkling with more sugar to keep the candies from sticking.</li>
        <li>Cut each flattened gummy piece into 3 strips. Fold each strip accordion-style to make ruffles; pinch the
            ends together.</li>
        <li>Make the cheese: Roll out the orange fondant on a cornstarch-dusted surface to about 1/8 inch thick. Trim
            the fondant into a 7-inch square; cover with plastic wrap and set aside.</li>
        <li>Trim the top of 1 round cake and the flat side of the bowl cake to make them level; crumble the trimmings.
            Mix the vanilla frosting, 4 tablespoons chocolate frosting and the yellow and red food coloring in a bowl to
            make a light brown frosting.</li>
        <li>Make the bottom bun: Put the trimmed round cake on a serving plate or cake board. Frost with some of the
            light brown frosting. Arrange the gummy-candy ruffles around the edge of the cake.</li>
        <li>Make the patty: Spread the remaining chocolate frosting over the top and sides of the untrimmed round cake.
            Press the crumbled cake trimmings into the frosting.</li>
        <li>Assemble the burger: Put the chocolate patty on the bottom bun, then drape the orange fondant on top. Frost
            the bowl-shaped cake with the remaining light brown frosting; place on the patty. Press the rice cereal into
            the frosting.</li>
    </ol>
