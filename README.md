# Learning frontend with The Odin Project

I started learning how to code in September, 2022. Since then I've been creating programs for my company and a web app to receive data from partners to automate processes within our system. I'm constantly wanting to skill up and branch out, so I started learning frontend development with The Odin Project. This is the first project I've started with TOP and I'm excited to see where I'll be a year from now.
